As shown in the attached repository, the name of the game is "treasure grab. The character starts at "s" and the goal is to find all the treasure which are marked by "x"(before the time runs out?). The character will also "die" if they touch the walls of the maze.

The game will all be build within canvas including the maze. It will mostly likely need a large hit detection function and display function for all the walls and treasures. The game message will display how many treasures you obtained until the game is over.

If time is allowed, it could change the layout of the maze each time a trasure is obtained. It could also place a new treasure somewhere each time one is obtained and the chracter can try to obtain as many treasures as they can before the time runs out.
